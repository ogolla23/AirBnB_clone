0x00. AirBnB clone - The console Project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Console is a text-based interface that allows the user to interact with the computer's operating system. 
The console is the first part of the AirBnB project that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. 

The goal of the AirBnB project is to deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB) to the server. 

This is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone.

COMMAND LINE INTEPRETER
A class of programs that are designed to read lines of text entered by a user.

A command interpreter is created in this stage to manage objects for the `AirBnB(HBnB) website by:
- Creating a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
- Performing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Updating attributes of an object
- Destroying an object


HOW TO START COMMAND LINE INTERPRETER
On Mac OS or Linux: 
Enter python in the command line to run the interactive Python interpreter. 

On Windows:
Open Command Prompt and enter py. 

HOW TO USE IT
It is used to:
- Interpret a sequence of lines of text which may be entered by a user,
- Read from a file 

HOT TO EXIT
Use the exit() function when you want to end your interactive Python session.
